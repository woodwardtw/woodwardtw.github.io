Imagine also that you&#8217;re dealing with many hundreds of students and don&#8217;t want the hassle of people asking you about password resets or any other attendant drama. You&#8217;re willing to give up some things in return for as much simplicity as possible.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve got a few options for front-end editors. Gravity Forms is one I use all the time but it doesn&#8217;t give you the full WP editor which is pretty handy if you&#8217;re asking students to write posts of any complexity. <a href=\"https:\/\/codecanyon.net\/item\/accesspress-anonymous-post-pro\/9160446\">AccessPress Anonymous Post Pro Forms<\/a> is another option that I used on this project. It&#8217;s worth checking out and I think there&#8217;s a free version as well. Alan and Brian&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/splot.ca\">SPLOT tools<\/a> are also worth checking out if your actions fit into those patterns consistently. <\/p>\n<p>That helps address one problem but it opens up a few other issues. We&#8217;ve got lots of students and lots of individual sections. How do we group them into courses or teams? How do we aggregate individual student&#8217;s work to their own page if they aren&#8217;t authors (in the WordPress sense)? Can we do that without drama?<\/p>\n<p>After a few false starts, I think this works pretty decently and it&#8217;s a possible twist on some of the ideas in <a href=\"https:\/\/community.reclaimhosting.com\/t\/2016-latest-course-syndication-best-practices-plugins\/157\">this conversation about Feed WordPress alternatives<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For students to be able to create their own individual pages I created a custom post type called &#8220;Personal.&#8221; It lets the student pick a banner image, give the page a name (their name, a pseudonym, whatever) . . . and a custom field. We&#8217;re suggesting an email address or something like that. That custom field is added to all the front end submission areas. The student page then essentially queries all the posts and returns any that have the matching custom field. <\/p>\n<p>The relevant chunk of the code is below. It&#8217;s based on a 6&#215;2 grid of thumbnails across the top and then all 12 assignments with full content below that.  <\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n&lt;?php \r\n\t\t\t\t$stu_id = get_post_meta( get_the_ID(), 'stu_id', true );\r\n\t\t\t\t\/\/ Check if the custom field has a value.\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t$the_query = new WP_Query( array( \r\n\t\t\t\t\t'meta_key' =&gt; 'stu_id',                    \/\/ Custom field key.\r\n    \t\t\t\t'meta_value' =&gt; $stu_id,                \/\/ Custom field value.\r\n\t\t\t\t ) );\r\n\t\t\t\t\/\/ The Loop\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tif ( $the_query-&gt;have_posts() ) :\r\n\t\t\t\t   echo '&lt;div class=&quot;personal-images&quot;&gt;';\t\r\n\t\t\t\twhile ( $the_query-&gt;have_posts() ) : $the_query-&gt;the_post();\r\n\t\t\t\t  $post_id = $post-&gt;ID;\r\n\t\t\t\t  \/\/image previews across top \r\n\t\t\t\t   echo '&lt;a href=&quot;' . get_permalink() .

Not perfect certainly but a different take on things that might be valuable for someone. <\/p>\n<h3>Team Pages<\/h3>\n<p>Now we get a bit stranger. <\/p>\n<p>Imagine we have many people teaching sessions but we really don&#8217;t want to manage them as users in WordPress but we want them to be able to create little class focused aggregate pages. This is harder than the student example because they&#8217;re going to be dealing with a bunch of students and probably some changes\/typos etc. so they need to be able to edit things. This brings up an interesting challenge. <\/p>\n<p>I ended up with a &#8220;solution&#8221; that may or may not be a disaster but it&#8217;s at least fairly unique.

Imagine also that you&#8217;re dealing with many hundreds of students and don&#8217;t want the hassle of people asking you about password resets or any other attendant drama. You&#8217;re willing to give up some things in return for as much simplicity as possible. You&#8217;ve got a few options for front-end editors. Gravity Forms is one I use all the time but it doesn&#8217;t give you the full WP editor which is pretty handy if you&#8217;re asking students to write posts of any complexity. AccessPress Anonymous Post Pro Forms is another option that I used on this project. It&#8217;s worth checking out and I think there&#8217;s a free version as well. Alan and Brian&#8217;s SPLOT tools are also worth checking out if your actions fit into those patterns consistently. That helps address one problem but it opens up a few other issues. We&#8217;ve got lots of students and lots of individual sections. How do we group them into courses or teams? How do we aggregate individual student&#8217;s work to their own page if they aren&#8217;t authors (in the WordPress sense)? Can we do that without drama?
